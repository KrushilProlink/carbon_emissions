            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'><strong>Q1: What is Go Sustainable all about? And why now?</strong></p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-5'>A1: It’s about urging the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) vertical of organizations to adopt sustainable measures while managing their marketing and corporate affairs operations. For the second question, why now? If not now, then when? </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'><strong>Q2: Why do you think that the CMO vertical of an organization has to follow sustainable measures?</strong></p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-5'>A2: With deep pockets, the CMO vertical is at the forefront, enhancing brand awareness, driving customer acquisition, and fostering overall business growth through the implementation of effective marketing strategies, contributing significantly to their organization’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives. But have these organizations ever looked behind the curtain to see how their own CMO vertical is contributing to the industry’s direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions? Now is the time for the CMO vertical to focus its efforts in this regard.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'><strong>Q3: You mentioned that the Organization’s CMO vertical is not embracing sustainable measures while executing their activities. Can you give us a couple of examples?</strong></p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'>A3: Yes, here are the two examples-</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'>Example 1: Let’s consider activities like promoting a product/solution or conducting a customer event. These generate a significant amount of direct and indirect GHG emissions. Travel, accommodation, local transportation, and wasted resources contribute to this impact.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-5'>Example 2: Take an ad campaign video shoot. This activity, if not managed sustainably, can have negative effects on the environment and social causes. Using harmful materials, consuming resources recklessly during the shoot can be detrimental. Our role is to identify and optimize areas that produce emissions.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'><strong>Q4: Do you mean to say that the Organization’s CMO vertical is not following sustainable measures? Why?</strong></p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-5'>A4: Yes, they are not, and the reason is a lack of awareness. For instance, not using plastic water bottles is one initiative, but there is a long road ahead. Lack of consideration for emissions during various activities, like events or campaigns, is a significant issue that needs attention.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'><strong>Q5: Does Go Sustainable claim that they have a net-zero framework?</strong></p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-5'>A5: Yes, we have a step-by-step process for various verticals—organizations, service providers, hotels, and exhibitors—to achieve net-zero by 2050 in their activities. Our vision aims to empower these verticals, guiding them to achieve a 50% reduction in both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'><strong>Q6: When we look onto the activities which the CMOs execute, they need service providers and hotel venues to drive those. What is your strategy in involving them in this entire process?</strong></p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-5'>A6: As mentioned earlier, we have separate frameworks for service providers and hotel venues that will guide them to reduce the carbon emissions they generate while supporting the marketing activities.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'><strong>Q7: There are big exhibitions happening at regular intervals conducted by government bodies and third-parties. What is your take on supporting these exhibitors?</strong></p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-5'>A7: We have a framework for everyone. Just connect with us, and we can have a dialogue. You can refer to our dedicated page for exhibitors for more details.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'><strong>Q8: If I have that framework copy, then why do I need Go Sustainable?</strong></p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-5'>A8: Frameworks are there to guide, but what you need is expertise, at least for a few months, where we can handhold you and help you to identify the areas that generate carbon emissions. The second part is the toughest, which is optimizing emissions, and it can only happen with a dialogue between all the other stakeholders. Last but not least, measuring and reporting emissions – not everyone can do that. So, you need us to complete the cycle.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'><strong>Q9: Any message to the Organization’s CMO vertical, service providers, hotel venues, and exhibitors?</strong></p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-5'>A9: For all these years, you have been executing a multitude of activities without considering the direct and indirect GHG emissions generated through your activities. It’s time for you to embrace sustainability as part of your overall corporate strategy and contribute to mitigating carbon emissions through your actions</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }} className=' mb-0'>There may be many more questions, what are you waiting for? Please <span style={{ color: "#4edceb" }}>reach out to us</span>, and let’s talk to create long-term value.</p>
